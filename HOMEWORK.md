# Homework Assignment

## Time Duration: 1 Week

## Tasks

### 1. Test Suite Task (50 Points)

In this task, you are required to create a Test Suite that combines three different test classes. These classes should be part of a small project such as a simple calculator or a string manipulation library.

#### Steps:

1. Create three different test classes for a small project.
    - `CalculatorTest`
    - `StringManipulatorTest`
    - `ArrayUtilitiesTest`

2. Combine these classes into a single Test Suite.
    - Use the `@Suite` annotation to specify the test classes.
    - Run the suite to ensure all tests are executed.

**Note**: Each test class should contain a minimum of 3 test methods of your own to test different functionalities of the project.

### 2. Mocking Task (50 Points)

Your second task is to utilize Mockito to mock a database service in a sample CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

#### Steps:

1. Create a simple CRUD application.
    - Define an interface for the database service.

2. Utilize Mockito to mock this database service.
    - Configure the mock to return specific values for methods like `create`, `read`, etc.

3. Write tests to validate the behavior of your CRUD application using the mock.
    - Use `verify()` to ensure that methods on the mock are called as expected.
